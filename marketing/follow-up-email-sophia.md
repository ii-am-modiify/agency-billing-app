# Follow-Up Email — Sophia Spatial AI

**Subject:** Following up — Forward Deployed Engineer + live project demo

Hi Marcos,

Thanks again for taking the time to speak with me about the Forward Deployed Engineer role at Sophia Spatial AI. The conversation got me even more excited about what you're building — the idea of layering spatial intelligence onto real-world environments is exactly the kind of problem I want to be solving.

I wanted to follow up with something concrete. I just shipped a full-stack billing automation system for a home health staffing agency — you can see it live here:

**https://staffing-agency-demo.fltechadventures.com/**

No login required — it's a fully interactive demo with 14 months of real-scale data (20K+ timesheets, auto-generated invoice PDFs, payroll tracking, the works). The source is also on GitHub if you want to look under the hood:

**https://github.com/ii-am-modiify/agency-billing-app**

Clone it, `docker-compose up`, and it seeds itself with demo data automatically.

I mention this because it speaks directly to what a Forward Deployed Engineer does — I sat with the client, understood their pain (weekends spent manually typing handwritten timecards into spreadsheets), and built them a system that handles it end-to-end. React frontend, Express/MongoDB backend, PDFKit for invoice generation, Docker containerized, security hardened, deployed behind a reverse proxy with SSL. The whole thing.

What excites me about Sophia is the chance to do that same kind of work — understanding what people actually need and building it — but at the intersection of AR and AI. DocuMind especially caught my eye given my background in document processing and automation.

I'd love to continue the conversation. Happy to do a technical deep-dive, pair on a problem, or whatever makes sense as a next step.

Best,
